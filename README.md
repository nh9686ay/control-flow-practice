# Control Flow Practice

The purpose of this exercise is to practice working with loops and conditionals.
Think of it as doing reps or practicing scales! The more you practice, the
better you'll get.

## Prerequisites

* Fundamental JavaScript: syntax, data types, and arrays
* Conditions, including `if`, `if`/`else`, and `if`/`else if`/`else`
* Loops, both `for` loops and `while` loops

## Instructions

1.  Fork and clone this repository.
1.  Change into the new directory.
1.  Fulfill the listed requirements.
1.  Submit your code via Pull Request.

Starter code is available in [`challenge.js`](challenge.js). You are
required to turn in your submission by making a pull request on the original
repository.

Unless otherwise specified on the calendar, your homework is due one week after it was assigned before class starts.

**Make a commit after each prompt.**

## Requirements

There are a series of prompts inside [`/challenge.js`](challenge.js).
Work through all of the prompts. Each prompt is in the form of a JavaScript
comment. Write your code to solve the prompt after the comment. Commit your code
after you solve a prompt.

Some prompts will require you to practice researching methods we did not learn
in class. This is intended to help you learn to become a more independent developer.

### Reminder: You are required to make a commit after each prompt.
